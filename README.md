\* You can use Ansible templates and ready-made CI/CD patterns for Jenkins and GitHub Action. 
Almost every repository contains pipeline patternsю Also integrated into the Ansible agent pipeline using its templates.

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting. Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.

I recommend using metrics collectors such as:
- Node-Exporter - for system analysis Linux Node
- cAdvisor - for Docker and Kubernetes

Why do I need a Prometheus?
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Flexible querying(PromQL)
- Time-series storage
- Alerting and Monitoring
- Free and Open-Source
- Scalability
- Integration with other tools
- High Performance(in-memory RAM)

My small fork example generates a configuration files for a reverse proxy balancing nginx which also regulates service availability at the level of service access rules. You can distribute external access to the service or restrict access. Provide access only to off-network users from VPN traffic or external IP addresses specified by you.

All you need to do to install Prometheus:
- My installed nginx-le image
- Specify your network parameters in docker manifest
- Change the env_example file to .env and set the variable values ​​in the .env file.
- Have free resources on the host/hosts
- Deploy docker compose manifest
- Move configuration files from the mounted volume prometheus_nginx_conf to the volume with the nginx configuration files of the nginx container:
  service* file to conf.d-le directory
  stream* file to stream.d-le directory
- Reboot Nginx container for apply configs
- Follow the instructions from the official Prometheus source for personalized service settings

\* You will also need to edit the Prometheus configuration file if your exporters are located outside the Prometheus host!
```
/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

Commands:

```bash
sudo sleep 30 && sudo cp /var/lib/docker/volumes/*nginx_conf/_data/conf/service-*.conf /var/lib/docker/volumes/nginx_data/_data/conf.d-le && \
sudo sleep 30 && sudo cp /var/lib/docker/volumes/*nginx_conf/_data/stream/stream-*.conf /var/lib/docker/volumes/nginx_data/_data/stream.d-le && \
docker restart nginx && \
sudo sleep 30 && docker exec -it nginx nginx -t

# To check the Prometheus configuration file
docker exec -it prometheus promtool check config /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```
